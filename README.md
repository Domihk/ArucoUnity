# ArUco Unity

OpenCV ArUco module for Unity 5.


## Build

- Build OpenCV with the extra module ArUco by following this tutorial: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

- Use CMake to configurate the ArUco Unity library. Here is the command:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DOpenCV_DIR=<opencv_install_dir> <aruco_unity_source_directory>
```

- Build the ArUco Unity library in the `<aruco_unity_build_directory>` folder. Open and compile the solution generated by cmake, or run this command:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ make
```

- Install the ArUco Unity library. The library will be copied into the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/bin` and `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/lib` folders, and in the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets/Plugins` folder. Compile the `RUN_TESTS` target on the solution generated by cmake, or run this command:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ make install
```


## Tests

Build and execute the tests. Here is the command:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DOpenCV_DIR=<opencv_install_dir> -DBUILD_TESTS=ON <aruco_unity_source_directory>
$ ctest
```


## Usage

- Retrieve the ArucoUnity Unity package on the Unity Asset Store (available soon). Or you can build the library source code (see the Build section), then copy `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets` folder into your Unity project.

- Open your Unity project and use the prefabs of the ArucoUnity package.
