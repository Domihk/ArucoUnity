# ArUco Unity

OpenCV's [ArUco](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d6a/group__aruco.html) Marker Detection module adapted for Unity 5.
The OpenCV's calibration modules [cablid3d](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html) and
[ccalib](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/ddc/group__ccalib.html) are also included.

This project has been developed as part of the master thesis of [Erwan Normand](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/normanderwan)
 and was supported by the [ÉTS - École de Technologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/).

## Usage

1. Retrieve the ArucoUnity package on the Unity Asset Store (available soon). Or you can build the library source code (see the Build section), then copy `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets` folder into your Unity project.
2. Use the prefabs or the examples scenes of the ArucoUnity package.
    - The `Assets/ArucoUnity/Scenes/Creation` scene demonstrates the creation of two different markers, one grid board, one ChArUco board and one diamond marker. Simply run the scene.
    - The `Assets/ArucoUnity/Scenes/Calibration` scene demonstrates the calibration of a camera. To use:
        - Configure the `Undistortion Type` and the `Camera Id` properties of the `ArucoCameraWebcam` in the scene.
        - Activate the `ArucoCalibrator` corresponding to the selected `Undistortion Type`.
        - Configure the `Calibration Board` used by the prefab according to the board you're going to use to calibrate your camera. Create a board with the Creation scene if you don't have any and print the generated image. 
        - Run the scene and interact with the UI to calibrate your camera. The calibration file will be automatically created and saved when the 'Calibrate' button is triggered.
    - The `Assets/ArucoUnity/Scenes/Tracking` scene demonstrates the tracking of a marker. To use:
        - Configure the `Undistortion Type`, the `Camera Id` properties of the `ArucoCameraWebcam` in the scene. If you have calibrated your camera, indicate the calibration file path (e.g. `Assets/ArucoUnity/Calibrations/<calibration_file>.xml`).
        - Create an empty object and add it an `ArucoMarker` script and configure it according to the printed marker you want to track. Add 3D content as a child of this object.
        - Add this object to the `Aruco Objects` list property of the `ArucoTracker` object. Make sure the `ArucoCamera` property of the  `ArucoTracker` object is linked to the`ArucoCameraWebcam` object configured earlier.
        - Run the scene. The `ArucoTracker` will place any detected marker in the `Aruco Objects` list relative to the camera of the `ArucoCamera` property.

## Build

### Configuration

Use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to configurate the ArUco Unity library. 

First, you will need to provide a build of OpenCV (minimum version: 3.2.0) with the ArUco module as dependency. You can follow these
instructions: [https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib). Or you
can build the provided cmake project by running the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <opencv_build_directory>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<opencv_install_dir> <aruco_unity_source_directory>/3rdparty/opencv_contrib/
$ cmake --build .
```

Then configure the ArUco Unity library by running the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DOpenCV_DIR=<opencv_install_dir> <aruco_unity_source_directory>
```

### Building

After configuration, open and compile the solution generated by cmake, or run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake --build .
```

### Installation

After building, compile the `INSTALL` target on the solution generated by cmake, or run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake --build . --target INSTALL
```

The library will be copied into the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/bin` and `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/lib`
folders, and into the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets/Plugins` folder.

## Tests

If you want to build and execute the tests, run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON <aruco_unity_source_directory>
$ ctest
```

The Google Test dependency will be automatically built. All tests should pass.
