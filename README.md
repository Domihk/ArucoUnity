# ArUco Unity

OpenCV ArUco module for Unity 5.


## Build

### Setup
First, you need to build OpenCV with the extra module ArUco. You can do it by following this tutorial: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

Then, use CMake to configurate the ArUco Unity library. Run the following commands:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DOpenCV_DIR=<opencv_install_dir> <aruco_unity_source_directory>
```

### Build
Open and compile the solution generated by cmake, or run the following commands:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ make
```

### Installation
Compile the `INSTALL` target on the solution generated by cmake, or run the following commands:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ make install
```

The library will be copied into the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/bin` and `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/lib` folders, and in the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets/Plugins` folder.


## Tests

If you want to build and execute the tests, run the following commands:

```
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DOpenCV_DIR=<opencv_install_dir> -DBUILD_TESTS=ON <aruco_unity_source_directory>
$ ctest
```

All tests should pass.


## Usage

- Retrieve the ArucoUnity Unity package on the Unity Asset Store (available soon). Or you can build the library source code (see the Build section), then copy `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets` folder into your Unity project.

- Open your Unity project and use the prefabs of the ArucoUnity package.
