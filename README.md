# ArUco Unity

OpenCV's ArUco Marker Detection module adapted for Unity 5.

This project has been developed as part of the master thesis of [Erwan Normand](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/normanderwan)
 and was supported by the [ÉTS - École de Technologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/).

## Usage

1. Retrieve the ArucoUnity package on the Unity Asset Store (available soon). Or you can build the library source code (see the Build section), then copy `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets` folder into your Unity project.
2. Open your Unity project and use the prefabs of the ArucoUnity package.

## Build

### Configuration

Use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to configurate the ArUco Unity library. By default, it will retrieve and build OpenCV
with the [ArUco module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco). Run the following commands,
it will take several minutes:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake <aruco_unity_source_directory>
```

If you want to provide your own version of OpenCV, add the following options to the cmake configuration command:
`-DAUTO_BUILD_OPENCV=OFF -DOpenCV_DIR=<opencv_install_dir>`. You need to build the ArUco module. Follow this
instructions: [https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib)

### Building

After configuration, open and compile the solution generated by cmake, or run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake --build .
```

### Installation

After building, compile the `INSTALL` target on the solution generated by cmake, or run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ make install
```

The library will be copied into the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/bin` and `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/lib`
folders, and into the `<aruco_unity_source_directory>/src/aruco_unity_package/Assets/Plugins` folder.

## Tests

If you want to build and execute the tests, run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <aruco_unity_build_directory>
$ cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON <aruco_unity_source_directory>
$ ctest
```

All tests should pass.

## Documentation

The documentation of the library is available online:
